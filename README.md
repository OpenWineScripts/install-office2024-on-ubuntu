# install-office2024-for-ubuntu

## Installation

To use this script, you need Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and execute this commands:

1. Give permissions to execute the script
```bash
chmod +x ./install-office2024.sh
```

2. Execute the script
```bash
./install-office2024.sh
```

## How it works?
This script installs Wine (if not already installed), the Wine prefix dependencies to run the program, and also applies the DLL replacements needed to run the Microsoft Office 2024 installer. So it will be easier.

## Contributions
If you want to make contributions to my project on GitHub, you can, including, create pull requests, create issues, donate money to help our project create more installation scripts, among others.

## Troubleshooting
If you have problems, make sure you are on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, as it only works on it; check if you have an Internet connection; and, if nothing works, create an issue in my repository and I will resolve it.
